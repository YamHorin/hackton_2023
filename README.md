# Hackton 2023

* I had an amazing experience at the 2023 hackRU hackathon, where I had the opportunity to work with a talented team of developers and designers on an innovative project.

* Our team tackled the challenge of finding trends in social media and creating campaigns using generative AI. We wanted to develop a system that could analyze large amounts of data and generate unique, personalized campaigns that would resonate with specific audiences.

* To accomplish this, we built a web driver using Java to collect and analyze data from various social media platforms. We then used machine learning and generative AI algorithms to generate campaign content that was tailored to specific target audiences.

* The experience of working on this project was incredible. We faced many challenges along the way, but our team pulled together and was able to deliver a functional prototype that we believe has a lot of potential.
